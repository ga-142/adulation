# adulation
This is an old tool I made for scraping websites and assembling google ads from the text.
This is something I was asked to upload by a reddit user. I'm not even sure what version I found here or if it
even works, but any one is free to use the code.


##installation
It's just PHP, so upload it or run it locally on a LAMP stack. No database is required.
